Slide 2:
eGovernment Services
E-government services have become an important instrument of public administration.
E-services trigger radical process changes in public administration organizations.
E-services offer considerable advantages like reduction in processing times thanks to electronic data transmission, automated data processing, e-invoicing, etc.
For example, the introduction of electronic tax declarations substituted former workflows (e.g., mail delivery, digitization of information or documents) and electronic completion of forms drastically limited incorrectly filled out declarations.

Slide 3:
eGovernment Service Maturity Models
The evolutionary process of the e-government service can be divided in specific development stages representing e-government services maturity models
These maturity models are used, for example, to compare the development status of different e-government portals, to support public service development, and to serve as a guide for evaluating and improving e-government portal quality
The maturity models can be classified into five groups, according to their overall development scope/highest development stage:
transaction,
integration,
transformation,
participation, and
open collaboration.
