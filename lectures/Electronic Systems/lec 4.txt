Slide 2:
Strategic Management of eGovernment
Market based View
To explain the competitive success of firms, we need a theory of strategy which links environmental circumstances and firm behavior to market outcomes
In the case of the public sector, this outcome may be seen as a service optimization and benefit maximization for the various public e-service demand groups (citizen, private, and public organizations).

Strategic Management of eGovernment
Resource based View
Regardless of the nature of the rents, sustained competitive advantage requires that the condition of heterogeneity be preserved
In public sector, competitive advantage means that governmental service provisions achieve a significant higher added value for their users than comparable service provisions of other public and private e-service providers

Slide 5:
e-Government Target Plan
Vision: generally understood as the central theme or the guiding principle of organizational activity
target focus—pursuing a future target state,
change focus—modifying basic organizational principles,
competitor focus—outperforming a competitor, or
role focus—becoming a role model

Slide 6:
e-Government Target Plan
Mission: The e-government mission differs from the vision in that it does not focus on an aspired future state of the organization, but defines a core statement regarding e-government purposes, values, and standards of conduct
Based on the e-government vision and mission, the next step is the derivation and operationalization of concrete organizational targets.
Targets should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Time related

Slide 11:
Open Government vs e-Government
“Open and responsive government refers to the transparency of government actions, the accessibility of government services and information, and the responsiveness of government to new ideas, demands and needs”
“Openness of government is the extent to which citizens can monitor and influence government processes through access to government information and access to decision-making arenas”
“Open government is widely understood as the leveraging of information technologies to generate participatory, collaborative dialogue between policymakers and citizens”

Slide 12:
Open Government vs e-Government
Both concepts are mandatory and mutually
e-government provides the required technological approach
open government the necessary conceptual framework.

Slide 13:
Summary
Convergence and Technology, State and Politics, Society and Economy, and Citizen Empowerment are the four drivers behind the e-government
EVAS, based on the system of value chain, guides the development of e-government strategy
E-government strategy takes into account both the market and the resource-based views to gain competitive advantage
Open Government and e-Government are both complementary concepts
