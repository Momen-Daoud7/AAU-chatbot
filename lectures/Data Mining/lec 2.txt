Slide 2:
Measuring the Dispersion of Data
Quartiles, outliers and boxplots
Quartiles: Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile)
Inter-quartile range: IQR = Q3 – Q1
Five number summary: min, Q1, median, Q3, max
Boxplot: ends of the box are the quartiles; median is marked; add whiskers, and plot outliers individually
Outlier: usually, a value higher/lower than 1.5 x IQR
Variance and standard deviation (sample: s, population: σ)
Variance: (algebraic, scalable computation)
Standard deviation s (or σ) is the square root of variance s2 (or σ2)

Slide 3:
Boxplot Analysis
Five-number summary of a distribution
Minimum, Q1, Median, Q3, Maximum
Boxplot
Data is represented with a box
The ends of the box are at the first and third quartiles, i.e., the height of the box is IQR
The median is marked by a line within the box
Whiskers: two lines outside the box extended
to Minimum and Maximum
Outliers: points beyond a specified outlier threshold, plotted individually

Slide 5:
Properties of Normal Distribution Curve
The normal (distribution) curve
From μ–σ to μ+σ: contains about 68% of the measurements	(μ: mean, σ: standard deviation)
From μ–2σ to μ+2σ: contains about 95% of it
From μ–3σ to μ+3σ: contains about 99.7% of it

Graphic Displays of Basic Statistical Descriptions

Boxplot: graphic display of five-number summary
Histogram: x-axis are values, y-axis repres. frequencies
indicating
Quantile plot:	each value xi	is paired with fi
that approximately 100 fi % of data	are  xi
Quantile-quantile (q-q) plot: graphs the quantiles of one univariant distribution against the corresponding quantiles of another
Scatter plot: each pair of values is a pair of coordinates and plotted as points in the plane

Slide 7:
Histogram Analysis
Histogram: Graph display of tabulated frequencies, shown as bars
It shows what proportion of cases fall into each of several categories
value, not the height as in bar
categories are not of uniform width
The categories are usually specified as non-overlapping intervals of some variable. The categories (bars) must be adjacent

Slide 8:
Histograms Often Tell More than Boxplots
The two histograms shown in the left may have the same boxplot representation
The same values for: min, Q1, median, Q3, max
But they have rather different data distributions

Slide 9:
Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) Plot
Graphs the quantiles of one univariate distribution against the corresponding quantiles of another
View: Is there is a shift in going from one distribution to another?
Example shows unit price of items sold at Branch 1 vs. Branch 2 for each quantile.	Unit prices of items sold at Branch 1 tend to be lower than those at Branch 2.

Slide 10:
Scatter plot
Provides a first look at bivariate data to see clusters of points, outliers, etc

Slide 14:
Data Visualization
13
Why data visualization?
Gain insight into an information space by mapping data onto graphical primitives
Provide qualitative overview of large data sets
Search for patterns, trends, structure, irregularities, relationships among data
Help find interesting regions and suitable parameters for further quantitative analysis
Provide a visual proof of computer representations derived
Categorization of visualization methods:
Pixel-oriented visualization techniques
Geometric projection visualization techniques
Icon-based visualization techniques
Hierarchical visualization techniques
Visualizing complex data and relations

Slide 15:
Pixel-Oriented Visualization Techniques
For a data set of m dimensions, create m windows on the screen, one for each dimension
The m dimension values of a record are mapped to m pixels at the corresponding positions in the windows
The colors of the pixels reflect the corresponding values

(b) Credit Limit
(c) transaction volume
(d) age

Slide 16:
Laying Out Pixels in Circle Segments
To save space and show the connections among multiple dimensions, space filling is often done in a circle segment

Parallel Coordinates
n equidistant axes which are parallel to one of the screen axes and correspond to the attributes
The axes are scaled to the [minimum, maximum]: range of the corresponding attribute
Every data item corresponds to a polygonal line which intersects each of the axes at the point which corresponds to the value for the attribute

Slide 21:
Icon-Based Visualization Techniques
13
Visualization of the data values as features of icons
Typical visualization methods
Chernoff Faces
Stick Figures
General techniques
Shape coding: Use shape to represent certain information encoding
Color icons: Use color icons to encode more information
Tile bars: Use small icons to represent the relevant feature vectors in document retrieval

Slide 22:
Chernoff Faces
A way to display variables on a two-dimensional surface, e.g., let x be
eyebrow slant, y be eye size, z be nose length, etc.
The figure shows faces produced using 10 characteristics--head eccentricity, eye size, eye spacing, eye eccentricity, pupil size, eyebrow slant, nose size, mouth shape, mouth size, and mouth opening): Each assigned one of 10 possible values, generated using Mathematica (S. Dickson)

Slide 24:
Dimensional Stacking
attribute 1
Partitioning of the n-dimensional attribute space in 2-D subspaces, which are ‘stacked’ into each other
Partitioning of the attribute value ranges into classes.	The important attributes should be used on the outer levels.
Adequate for data with ordinal attributes of low cardinality
But, difficult to display more than nine dimensions
Important to map dimensions appropriately
attribute 2
attribute 3
attribute 4

Slide 28:
InfoCube
A 3-D visualization technique where hierarchical information is displayed as nested semi-transparent cubes
The outermost cubes correspond to the top level data, while the subnodes or the lower level data are represented as smaller cubes inside the outermost cubes, and so on

Slide 29:
Three-D Cone Trees

3D cone tree visualization technique works well for up to a thousand nodes or so
First build a 2D circle tree that arranges its nodes in concentric circles centered on the root node
Cannot avoid overlaps when projected to 2D

Similarity
Numerical measure of how alike two data objects are
Value is higher when objects are more alike
Often falls in the range [0,1]
Dissimilarity (e.g., distance)
Numerical measure of how different two data objects are
Lower when objects are more alike
Minimum dissimilarity is often 0
Upper limit varies
Proximity refers to a similarity or dissimilarity

negative when the raw score is below the mean, “+” when above
An alternative way: Calculate the mean absolute deviation

Slide 41:
Cosine Similarity
A document can be represented by thousands of attributes, each recording the frequency of a particular word (such as keywords) or phrase in the document.
Other vector objects: gene features in micro-arrays, …
Applications: information retrieval, biologic taxonomy, gene feature
mapping, ...
Cosine measure: If d1 and d2 are two vectors (e.g., term-frequency vectors), then
cos(d1, d2) =	(d1  d2) /||d1|| ||d2|| ,
where  indicates vector dot product, ||d||: the length of vector d
31

Slide 42:
Example: Cosine Similarity
42
cos(d1, d2) =	(d1  d2) /||d1|| ||d2|| ,
where  indicates vector dot product, ||d|: the length of vector d
Ex: Find the similarity between documents 1 and 2.
d1 =	(5, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)
d2 =	(3, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)
d1d2 = 5*3+0*0+3*2+0*0+2*1+0*1+0*1+2*1+0*0+0*1 = 25
||d1||=	(5*5+0*0+3*3+0*0+2*2+0*0+0*0+2*2+0*0+0*0)0.5=(42)0.5
= 6.481
||d2||=	(3*3+0*0+2*2+0*0+1*1+1*1+0*0+1*1+0*0+1*1)0.5=(17)0.5
= 4.12
cos(d1, d2 ) = 0.94
