Why Data Mining?
2
The Explosive Growth of Data: from terabytes to petabytes
Data collection and data availability
Automated data collection tools, database systems, Web,  computerized society
Major sources of abundant data
Business: Web, e-commerce, transactions, stocks, …
Science: Remote sensing, bioinformatics, scientific simulation, …
Society and everyone: news, digital cameras, YouTube
We are drowning in data, but starving for knowledge!
“Necessity is the mother of invention”—Data mining—Automated  analysis of massive data sets

Slide 4:
Evolution of Sciences
2
Before 1600, empirical science
1600-1950s, theoretical science
Each discipline has grown a theoretical component. Theoretical models often  motivate experiments and generalize our understanding.
1950s-1990s, computational science
Over the last 50 years, most disciplines have grown a third, computational branch  (e.g. empirical, theoretical, and computational ecology, or physics, or linguistics.)
Computational Science traditionally meant simulation. It grew out of our inability to  find closed-form solutions for complex mathematical models.
1990-now, data science
The flood of data from new scientific instruments and simulations
The ability to economically store and manage petabytes of data online
The Internet and computing Grid that makes all these archives universally accessible
Scientific info. management, acquisition, organization, query, and visualization tasks  scale almost linearly with data volumes.	Data mining is a major new challenge!
