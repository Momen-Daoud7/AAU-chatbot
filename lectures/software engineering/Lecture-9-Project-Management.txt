Project Management
TOPICS COVERED

• Management activities
• Project planning
• Project scheduling
• Risk management
SOFTWARE PROJECT
MANAGEMENT
• Concerned with activities involved in ensuring
  that software is delivered on time and on
  schedule and in accordance with the
  requirements of the organisations developing
  and procuring the software.
• Project management is needed because
  software development is always subject to
  budget and schedule constraints that are set by
  the organisation developing the software.
SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT DISTINCTIONS



    • The product is intangible.
    • The product is uniquely flexible.
    • Software engineering is not recognized as an
      engineering discipline with the sane status as
      mechanical, electrical engineering, etc.
    • The software development process is not
      standardised.
    • Many software projects are 'one-off' projects.
MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

• Proposal writing.
• Project planning and scheduling.
• Project costing.
• Project monitoring and reviews.
• Personnel selection and evaluation.
• Report writing and presentations.
PROJECT STAFFING

• May not be possible to appoint the ideal
  people to work on a project
   • Project budget may not allow for the use of
     highly-paid staff;
   • Staff with the appropriate experience may not
     be available;
   • An organisation may wish to develop employee
     skills on a software project.
• Managers have to work within these constraints
  especially when there are shortages of trained
  staff.
PROJECT PLANNING

• Probably the most time-consuming project
  management activity.
• Continuous activity from initial concept through
  to system delivery. Plans must be regularly
  revised as new information becomes available.
• Various different types of plan may be
  developed to support the main software project
  plan that is concerned with schedule and
  budget.
THE PROJECT PLAN

• The project plan sets out:
   • The resources available to the project;
   • The work breakdown;
   • A schedule for the work.
PROJECT PLAN STRUCTURE

• Introduction.
• Project organisation.
• Risk analysis.
• Hardware and software resource requirements.
• Work breakdown.
• Project schedule.
• Monitoring and reporting mechanisms.
ACTIVITY ORGANIZATION

• Activities in a project should be organised to
  produce tangible outputs for management to
  judge progress.
• Milestones are the end-point of a process
  activity.
• Deliverables are project results delivered to
  customers.
• The waterfall process allows for the
  straightforward definition of progress milestones.
PROJECT SCHEDULING

• Split project into tasks and estimate time and
  resources required to complete each task.
• Organize tasks concurrently to make optimal
  use of workforce.
• Minimize task dependencies to avoid delays
  caused by one task waiting for another to
  complete.
• Dependent on project managers intuition and
  experience.
SCHEDULING PROBLEMS

• Estimating the difficulty of problems and hence
  the cost of developing a solution is hard.
• Productivity is not proportional to the number of
  people working on a task.
• Adding people to a late project makes it later
  because of communication overheads.
• The unexpected always happens. Always allow
  contingency in planning.
RISK MANAGEMENT

•   Risk management is concerned with identifying
    risks and drawing up plans to minimise their
    effect on a project.
•   A risk is a probability that some adverse
    circumstance will occur
    •   Project risks affect schedule or resources;
    •   Product risks affect the quality or performance of the
        software being developed;
    •   Business risks affect the organisation developing or
        procuring the software.
SOFTWARE RISKS

 Risk                      Affects       Description
 Staff turnover            Project       Experienced staff will leave the project before it is finished.
 Management change         Project       There will be a change of organisational management with
                                         different priorities.
 Hardware unavailability   Project       Hardware that is essential for the project will not be
                                         delivered on schedule.
 Requirements change       Project and   There will be a larger number of changes to the
                           product       requirements than anticipated.
 Specification delays      Project and   Specifications of essential interfaces are not available on
                           product       schedule
 Size underestimate        Project and   The size of the system has been underestimated.
                           product
 CASE tool under-          Product       CASE tools which support the project do not perform as
 performance                             anticipated
 T echnology change        Business      The underlying technology on which the system is built is
                                         superseded by new technology.
 Product competition       Business      A competitive product is marketed before the system is
                                         completed.
THE RISK MANAGEMENT
PROCESS
•   Risk identification
     •   Identify project, product and business risks;
•   Risk analysis
     •   Assess the likelihood and consequences of these risks;
•   Risk planning
     •   Draw up plans to avoid or minimise the effects of the risk;
• Risk monitoring
     •   Monitor the risks throughout the project;
THE RISK MANAGEMENT
PROCESS
RISK IDENTIFICATION

• Technology risks.
• People risks.
• Organisational risks.
• Requirements risks.
• Estimation risks.
RISK ANALYSIS

• Assess probability and seriousness of each risk.
• Probability may be very low, low, moderate, high
  or very high.
• Risk effects might be catastrophic, serious,
  tolerable or insignificant.
RISK PLANNING

•   Consider each risk and develop a strategy to
    manage that risk.
•   Avoidance strategies
    •   The probability that the risk will arise is reduced;
•   Minimisation strategies
    •   The impact of the risk on the project or product will be
        reduced;
•   Contingency plans
    •   If the risk arises, contingency plans are plans to deal with
        that risk;
RISK MONITORING

• Assess each identified risks regularly to decide
  whether or not it is becoming less or more
  probable.
• Also assess whether the effects of the risk have
  changed.
• Each key risk should be discussed at
  management progress meetings.
