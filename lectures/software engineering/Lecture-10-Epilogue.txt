 What will be the future of the field?
 What is the impact of SE on society?
 What ethical issues are raised by SE?

Ground principles
 SE requires the application of engineering principles
  guided by informed management
 Principles must be rooted in sound theory
 Rigorous approaches must be combined with
  experimentation, intuition, and common sense
 No “silver bullets”

Progress expected
 Increased specialization
    specialization is a sign of maturity of a discipline
 Component-based development
 Standard domain-specific architectures
 Increased reuse
 Distributed virtual teams

Social responsibility
 Software defects may cost lives or tremendous
  business losses
   we should try to prevent them
   we should study them when they occur, to avoid
    failures in the future
 Software creates new opportunities for
  increasing productivity and services, but also
  opportunities for criminal fraud and sabotage
  (e.g., viruses)
 Building reliable software is not only a technical
  goal; it has ethical and social implications for
  the serious professional
                                                       5
Code of ethics
 The ACM and IEEE Computer Society have
  developed a “Software engineering code of ethics
  and professional practices”
 The “public interest” is central to the code, which
  emphasizes the professional’s obligation to the
  public at large
   primary concern for the health, safety, and welfare of
    the public

Code of ethics principles
1. Public
       Software engineers shall act consistently with the public
       interest
2. Client and Employer
       Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the
       best interests of their client and employer, consistent with
       the public interest
3. Product
       Software engineers shall ensure that their products and
       related modifications meet the highest professional
       standards possible
4. Judgment
       Software engineers shall maintain integrity and
       independence in their professional judgment


                                                                      7
 Code of ethics principles (cont.)
5. Management
          Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to
          and promote an ethical approach to the management of
          software development and maintenance
6. Profession
          Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation
          of the profession, consistent with the public interest
7. Colleagues
          Software engineers shall be fair to, and supportive of, their
          colleagues
8. Self
          Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning
          regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an
          ethical approach to the practice of the profession


                                                                            8
