   Specification
 A broad term that means definition
 Used at different stages of software development
  for different purposes
 Generally, a statement of agreement (contract)
  between
   producer and consumer of a service
   implementer and user
 All desirable qualities must be specified



                                                     2
Uses of specification
 Statement of user requirements
    major failures occur because of misunderstandings
     between the producer and the user
    "The hardest single part of building a softwarem system
     is deciding precisely what to build"




                                                               3
Uses of specification (cont.)
 Statement of the interface between the machine and
 the controlled environment
   serious undesirable effects can result due to
    misunderstandings between software engineers and
    domain experts about the phenomena affecting the
    control function to be implemented by software




                                                       4
Uses of specification (cont.)
 Statement of requirements for implementation
   design process is a chain of specification (i.e.,
    definition)–implementation–verification steps
       requirements specification refers to definition of external
        behavior
           design specification must be verified against it
       design specification refers to definition of the software
        architecture
           code must be verified against it




                                                                      5
Uses of specification (cont.)
 A reference point during maintenance
    corrective maintenance only changes implementation
    adaptive and perfective maintenance occur because of
     requirements changes
       requirements specification must change accordingly




                                                             6
Specification qualities
     Precise, clear, unambiguous
     Consistent
     Complete
        internal completeness
        external completeness
     Incremental



                                    7
Clear, unambiguous, understandable
 Example: specification fragment for a word-
 processor

  Selecting is the process of designating
  areas of the document that you want to
  work on. Most editing and formatting
  actions require two steps: first you
  select what you want to work on,
  such as text or graphics; then you
  initiate the appropriate action.

 can an area be scattered?
                                                8
Precise, unambiguous, clear
 Another example (from a real safety-critical
 system)

The message must be triplicated.          The three
copies must be forwarded through          three
different physical channels. The          receiver
accepts the message on the basis          of a
two-out-of-three voting policy.




                                                      9
Consistent
 Example: specification fragment for a word-processor


 The whole text should be kept in lines
 of equal length. The length is specified
 by the user. Unless the user gives an
 explicit hyphenation command,
 a carriage return should occur only
 at the end of a word.


What if the length of a word exceeds the length of the line?


                                                          10
Complete
 Internal completeness
    the specification must define any new concept or
     terminology that it uses
        glossary helpful for this purpose
   the specification must document all the needed
    requirements
        difficulty: when should one stop?




                                                        11
Incremental
 Referring to the specification process
    start from a sketchy document and progressively add
     details

 Referring to the specification document

   document is structured and can be understood in
    increments



                                                           12
Classification of specification styles
  Informal, semi-formal, formal


  Operational
    Behavior specification in terms of some abstract
     machine

  Descriptive
    Behavior described in terms of properties



                                                        13
How to verify a specification?

 “Observe” dynamic behavior of specified
 system (simulation, prototyping, “testing”
 specs)

 Analyze properties of the specified system

Patient monitoring systems
The purpose is to monitor the patients’ vital factors--blood,
pressure, temperature, …--reading them at specified frequencies
from analog devices and storing readings in a DB. If readings fall
outside the range specified for patient or device fails an alarm
must be sent to a nurse. The system also provides reports.

Conclusions
 Specifications describe
   what the users need from a system (requirements
      specification)
     the design of a software system (design and
      architecture specification)
     the features offered by a system (functional
      specification)
     the performance characteristics of a system
      (performance specification)
     the external behavior of a module (module interface
      specification)
     the internal structure of a module (internal
