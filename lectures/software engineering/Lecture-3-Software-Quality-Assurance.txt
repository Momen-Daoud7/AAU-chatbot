What is Software ?
According to the IEEE
Software is:
  Computer programs, procedures, and
  possibly associated documentation and
  data pertaining to the operation of a
  computer system.
Software Errors, software faults
and software failures
 Bug/defect/fault consequence of a human error.
    Results in non-conformance to requirements.
    Manifests as failure in running software.

                                           software error
                                           software fault
                                           software failure
Nine Causes of Software Errors
 Faulty requirements definition.
 Client-developer communication failures.
 Deliberate deviations from software
 requirements.
 Logical design errors.
 Coding errors.
 Non-compliance with documentation and
 coding instructions.
 Shortcomings of the testing process.
 User interface and procedure errors.
 Documentation errors.

When are defects introduced?
 The majority of defects are introduced in earlier
  phases.
   Requirements are the top factor in a project’s
    success or failure.

What is Software Quality ?
 Conformance to requirements.
 Narrowest sense of software quality.
   Lack of bugs.
   Low defect rate (# of defects/size unit)
   High reliability (number of failures per n hours of
    operation).
        Mean Time To Failure (MTTF): probability of failure-free
         operation in a specified time.
What is Software Quality ?
 According to the IEEE:
 Software quality is:
  1. The degree to which a system, component, or process
     meets specified requirements.
  2. The degree to which a system, component, or process
     meets customer or user needs or expectations.
   What is Software Quality ?

 According to Pressman:
 Software quality is:
  Conformance to explicitly stated functional and
  performance requirements, explicitly documented
  development standards, and implicit characteristics
  that are expected of all professionally developed
  software.
Importance of Software Quality
 Software is a major component of computer systems (about
  80% of the cost) – used for
    Communication (e.g. phone system, email system).
    Health monitoring.
    Transportation (e.g. automobile, aeronautics).
    Economic exchanges (e.g. e-commerce).
    Entertainment.
    etc.
 Software defects are extremely costly in term of
    money
    reputation
    loss of life
Importance of Software Quality

 Notable consequences of software errors:
   1988 shooting down of Airbus 320 by the USS Vincennes
    - cryptic and misleading output displayed by tracking
    software.
   1991 patriot missile failure - inaccurate calculation of
    time due to computer arithmetic errors.
   London Ambulance Service Computer Aided Dispatch
    System – several deaths.
Importance of Software Quality

  On June 3, 1980, the North American Aerospace Defence
   Command (NORAD) reported that the U.S. was under
   missile attack.
  First operational launch attempt of the space shuttle,
   whose real-time operating software consists of about
   500,000 lines of code, failed - synchronization problem
   among its flight-control computers.
  9 hour breakdown of AT&T's long-distance telephone
   network - caused by an untested code patch.

Importance of Software Quality
 Ariane 5 explosion June 4, 1996
   First flight of the European Ariane 5 launcher crashed
    about 40 seconds after takeoff.
   Cost was about half a billion dollars.
   Explosion was the result of a software error:
     Uncaught exception due to floating-point error:
      conversion from a 64-bit integer to a 16-bit signed
      integer applied to a larger than expected number.
     Module was re-used without proper testing from
      Ariane 4 .
        Error was not supposed to happen with Ariane 4.

        No exception handler.
Importance of Software Quality

 Monetary impact of poor software quality (Standish
  group - 1995)
 175,000 software projects/year - Average Cost per
  project
   Large companies - $US 2,322,000
   Medium companies - $US 1,331,000
   Small companies - $US 434,000
 31.1% of projects canceled before completed.
    cost $81 billion
Importance of Software Quality
 52.7% of projects exceed their budget - costing 189% of
 original estimates.
   cost $59 billion
 16.2% of software projects completed on-time and on-
  budget (9% for larger companies).
 Large companies - delivered systems have
  approximately only 42% of originally-proposed
  features and functions.
 78.4% of smaller companies projects get deployed with
  at least 74.2% of their original features and functions.
